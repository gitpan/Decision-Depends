Revision history for Perl extension Decision::Depends.

0.18  Mon Mar  3 14:44:09 EST 2008
        - Variable dependencies may now be hashes and arrays as well
	  as scalars.

0.17  Tue Sep 20 15:46:20 EDT 2005
        - Test::More::eq_hash (v0.6) is more thorough than v0.47,
	  which broke t/sig.t
	- useless (and incorrect) deletion of attributes in t/traverse.t
	  led to warning

0.16  Sun Jul 13 16:15:43 EDT 2003
        - verbose output is sent to STDOUT now.

0.15  Thu Jun 26 13:32:43 EDT 2003
        - added hash ref means of associating attribute values and
	  ordinary values
	- modified variable dependencies so can find name of variable
	  in attribute value.  this allows easy specification of
	  variable names and values via the hashref method above.

0.14  Wed Jan 22 00:17:32 EST 2003
        - AutoSave option was undocumented and no longer needed.
	- Added warning about absolute path for dependency file to docs.

0.13  Tue Jan 21 13:54:33 EST 2003
        - needed to bump up Carp::CarpLevel at the Depends.pm level.

0.12  Sat Jan 11 00:39:02 EST 2003
        - Force had no effect if a target had no dependencies.
	- added force attribute to targets

0.11  Tue Dec 31 10:56:58 EST 2002
        - Yikes. was developing with older version of YAML;
	  latest version has DumpFile, not StoreFile.
	  require YAML 0.35

0.10  Tue Dec 31 10:21:56 EST 2002
        - release to CPAN.  Now called Decision::Depends.
	  no more 'use Depends'. awww.

0.09  Wed Apr 10 10:20:48 EDT 2002
        - variable dependencies now try to guess if the value is a
	  number and perform a numeric comparison.  This may be
	  forced or overridden with the new -numcmp and -strcmp attributes.
	- documented variable dep. -case attribute.
	- added Depends::renew() for testing purposes.
	- removed dependency Attr hashes; they should all use State
	  Attrs via State methods.
		

0.08  Tue Apr  2 01:08:18 EST 2002
        - test for dependency existance in Time->new didn't
	  check the State cache (good when Pretend => 1 ).
	  it seems to be a duplicate check, as it's also done
	  (correctly) in Time->depends.  So, yank the check in new().

0.07  Mon Apr  1
        - configure is more flexible in regards to the form of its
	  arguments
	- OO::new was calling (via configure) $self->{State}->SetAttr
	  before $self->{State} was created.
	- Target::mkSFile wasn't correctly updating the modify time
	  if the sfile already existed.

0.06  Wed Mar 27 20:24:27 EST 2002
        - State->getVar was incorrectly treating variables
	  with values of 0 as being undefined.  oops.

0.05  Mon Mar 25 13:22:33 EST 2002

        - first recasting of top level Depends interface into OO
          module by moving most of the front end code into Depends::OO.
          Depends.pm now is just a wrapper around Depends::OO.

	- Depends::init superceded by Depends::Configure.

	- added Force and -force global and local attributes to force
	  dependencies to be out of date.

	- no longer use File::stat, as it causes conniptions for
	  testing under 5.6.1.

0.04  Thu Mar 21 19:48:11 EST 2002
        - added test_dep()

0.03  Thu Mar  7 16:45:04 EST 2002
        - further message tweaks.
	- Verbose > 4 gives object creation messages.
	- must have broken non-existant signature and variable code,
	  cause it didn't work.  does now.

0.02  Wed Mar  6 12:07:20 EST 2002
        - uses YAML instead of Data::Denter, as had corruption
	  problems with the latter
        - minor error message tweaks

0.01  Mon Feb  4 11:26:18 2002
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-n Depends -A -X
