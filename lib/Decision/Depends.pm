=head1 NAME

Decision::Depends - Perform actions based upon file dependencies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Decision::Depends;

  Decision::Depends::Configure( { File => $depfile } );
  if_dep { @targ_dep_list } 
     action { action };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Decision::Depends> is a module which simplifies the creation of
procedures with intermediate steps which can be skipped if certain
dependencies are met.  Think of it as a procedural version of B<make>.

B<Decision::Depends> is useful when there are several steps in a
process, each of which depends upon the last.  If the process is
interrupted, or if it is to be redone with changes to parameters in
later steps, and if intermediate results can be kept, then
B<Decision::Depends> can insure that only the minimal number of steps
be redone.

Each step must result in a tangible product (a file).  For complicated
steps with many products the step's successful completion may be
indicated by creating an empty file whose existance indicates
completion.  This file (a C<status> file in B<Decision::Depends>
terminology) can be automatically created if requested.

B<Decision::Depends> determines if the product for a given step is
older than any files required to produce it.  It can also check
whether the contents of a file have changed since the product was last
created.  This is useful in the case where a configuration file must
be created anew each time, but results in action only if changed since
the product was last created. Finally, it can determine if a
variable's value has changed since the product was last created.

=head2 Dependency history

B<Decision::Depends> must keep some dependency information between
runs (for signature and variable dependencies). It stores this in a
file, which must be named by the application.  The application
indicates the file by calling the B<Decision::Depends::Configure>
subroutine.

This file is updated after completion of successful actions and
when the program is exited.

=head2 Dry Runs and Changing other behavior

B<Decision::Depends> can be put into a state where it checks
dependencies and pretends to update targets in order to check what
actions might need to be taken.  This is done by passing the
C<Pretend> attribute to B<Decision::Depends::Configure>.  In this mode
no actions are actually performed, but are assumed to have
successfully created their products.

B<Decision::Depends> will output to STDOUT its musings if the
C<Verbose> attribute is passed to B<Decision::Depends::Configure>.

To simply test if a dependency exists, without requiring that an
action be performed, use the B<test_dep> function.


=head2 Targets and Dependencies List

Each step must construct a single Perl list of products, also called
targets (as in B<make>), and dependencies.  The list has a simple
syntax - it is a sequence of values, each of which may have one or
more attributes.  Attributes precede values and apply only to the next
value (unless values are grouped), and always begin with a C<->
character.  Multiple attributes may be applied to a single value.

	-target => $file, -depend => -sig => $dep

(Note the use of the perl C<< => >> operator to avoid quoting of
attributes.)  Values which begin with the C<-> character (which may be
confused with attributes) may be passed by reference.  B<Depend>
recognizes negative numbers, so those need not be handled specially.

	-target => \'-strange_file', -target => -33.99e24

Values may be grouped by placing them in anonymous arrays:

	-target => [ $file1, $file2 ]

Attributes are applied to all elements of the group; additional attributes
may modify individual group members:

	-target => [ -sfile => $file1, $file2 ]

Groups may be nested.

To negate an attribute, introduce the same attribute with a prefix of
C<-no_>:

	-target => -sfile => [ $file1, -no_sfile => $file2 ]

Attributes may have values, although they are in general boolean values.
The syntax is '-attr=value'.  Note that because of the C<=> character,
Perl's automatic quoting rules when using the C<< => >> operator are
insufficient to ensure appropriate quoting.  For example

	'-slink=foo' => $target

assigns the C<-slink> attribute to C<$target> and gives the attribute
the value C<foo>.  If no value is specified, a default value of C<1>
is assigned.  Most attributes are boolean, so no value need be assigned
them.

Hash references may be used to pair attribute values with ordinary
values.  For example, the following

	-var => { $attr1 => $val1, $attr2 => $val2 }

assigns C<$val1> the attribute C<-var> with the value C<$attr1>,
C<$val2> the attribute C<-var> with the value C<$attr2>, etc.  This is
most useful when specifying variable dependencies (see L<Dependencies>).


=head2 Targets

Targets are identified either by having the C<-target> or C<-targets>
attributes, or by being the first value (or group) in the
target-dependency list and not having the C<-depend> attribute.  For
example, the following are equivalent

	( -target => $targ1, -target => $targ2, ... )
	( -target => [ $targ1, $targ2 ], ... )
	( [ $targ1, $targ2 ], ... )

There must be at least one target. Target values may have the
following attributes:

=over 8

=item B<-target>

This indicates the value is a target.

=item B<-sfile>

This indicates that the target is a status file.  It will be automatically
created upon successful completion of the step.

=item B<-slink=<linkfile>>

This indicates that the target is a status file which is linked to an
imaginary file C<linkfile>.  Any step which explicitly depends upon
C<linkfile> will instead depend upon the target file instead.
Multiple links to C<linkfile> may be created. Links are checked in
order of appearance, and are useful only as time dependencies.  For
example, rather than depending upon the target of the previous step, a
step might depend upon the C<linkfile>.  It's then possible to
introduce new intermediate steps which link their status files to
C<linkfile> without having to rewrite the current step.  For example

	( -target => '-slink=step1' => 'step1a', ... )
	( -target => '-slink=step1' => 'step1b', ... )

	( -target => $result, -depend => 'step1' )

In this case, the final step will depend upon F<step1a> and F<step1b>.
One could later add a F<step1c> and not have to change the dependencies
for the final step.

The target status file will be automatically created upon successful
completion of the step.

=item C<-force>

If set to non-zero (the default if no value is specified), this will
force the target to always be out-of-date.  This can be used to
override a global forcing of out-of-dateness (done via the
B<Depend::Configure> function) by setting it to zero.  It is probably
most useful for targets which have no dependencies.

=back


=head2 Dependencies

Dependencies are identified either as I<not> being the first value (or
group) in the list and not having the C<-target> attribute, or by
having the attributes C<-depend> or C<-depends>.  There need not be
any dependencies.

There are three types of dependencies: I<time>, I<signature>, and
I<variable>.  The default type is I<time>.  The defining attributes
are:

=over 8

=item C<-time>

Time dependencies are the default if no attribute is not specified.  A
time dependency results in a comparison of the timestamps of the
target and dependency files.  If the target is older than the
dependency file, the step must be redone.

=item C<-sig>

Signature dependencies check the current contents of the dependency
file against the contents the last time the target was created.  If
the contents have changed, the step must be redone.  An MD5 checksum
signature is computed for signature dependency files; these are what
is stored and compared.

A new signature is recorded upon successful completion of the step.

=item C<-var>

Variable dependencies check the value of a variable against its value
the last time the target was created. If the contents have changed,
the step must be redone.  The new value is recorded upon successful
completion of the step.

Variable values may be scalars, hashes, or arrays. The latter two
B<must> be passed as a reference to a hashref and a reference to an
arrayref (not just plain hashrefs and arrayrefs), as B<Decision::Depends>
uses hashrefs and arrayrefs to group values and atributes.  For example,

  \\%hash
  \$hashref
  \\@array
  \$arrayref


There are several methods of specifying the variable name and value.

=over 8

=item *

The B<-var> attribute may be assigned the name of the variable:

	'-var=var_name' => $var_value

This leads to fairly crufty looking code:

	'-var=var1_name' => $var1_value,
	'-var=var2_name' => $var2_value

So the use of a hash reference to pair the variable names and values
comes in handy:

	-var => { var1_name => $var1_value,
	          var2_name => $var2_value }

This allows the nice short hand of

	-var => \%variables

With this method, you cannot have a variable named C<1>, which
shouldn't be too limiting.

=item *

The variable name can be provided as if it were another attribute:

	-var => -var_name => $var_value

With this method variables cannot have the same name as any of the
reserved names for attributes.

=back

Scalar variable dependencies may have the following additional attributes:

=over 8

=item C<-case>

If specified, variable value comparisons will be case sensitive.  They
are normally not case sensitive.

=item C<-numcmp>

If specified, treat the value as a number (integer or floating point).
Generally B<Decision::Depends> does a good job at guessing whether a
value is a number or not; this forces it to treat it as a number if it
guesses wrong.  This may not be mixed with the B<-strcmp> attribute.

=item C<-strcmp>

If specified, treat the value as a string.  Generally
B<Decision::Depends> does a good job at guessing whether a value is a
number or not; this forces it to treat it as a string if it guesses
wrong.  This may not be mixed with the B<-str> attribute.

=back

Hash and array values are compared via B<Data::Compare>; there is no
means of forcing numeric or string comparisons.

=back

Dependencies may be given special attributes independent of the type
of dependency.  These are:

=over 8

=item C<-force>

If set to non-zero (the default if no value is specified), this will
force the dependency to always be out-of-date.  This can be used to
override a global forcing of dependencies (done via the
B<Depend::Configure> function) by setting it to zero.  For example:

  Decision::Depends::Configure( { Force => 1 } );
  if_dep { -target => $target,
           -depend => '-force=0' => $dep }
  action { ... }


=back

=head2 Action specification

B<Decision::Depends> exports the function B<if_dep>, which is used by
the application to specify the targets and dependencies and the action
to be taken if the dependencies have not been met.  It has the form

  if_dep { targdep }
     action { actions };

where I<targdep> is Perl code which results in a target and dependency
list and I<actions> is Perl code to generate the target.  Note the
final semi-colon.

The target dependency list code is generally very simple:

  if_dep { -target => 'foo.out', -depend => 'foo.in' }
     action { ... }

The action routine is passed (via C<@_>) a reference to a hash with
the names of targets whose dependencies were not met as the keys.  The
values are hash references, with the following keys:

=over 8

=item time

A reference to an array of the dependency files which were newer than
the target.

=item var

A reference to an array of the variables whose values had changed.

=item sig

A reference to an array of the files whose content signatures had changed.

=back

If these lists are empty, the target file does not exist.  For example,

  if_dep { -target => 'foo.out', -depend => 'foo.in' }
    action {
      my ( $deps ) = @_;
      ...
    };

If F<foo.out> did not exist

  $deps = { 'foo.out' => { time => [], 
			   var => [],
 			   sig => [] } };

If F<foo.out> did exist, but was older than F<foo.in>,

  %deps = { 'foo.out' => { time => [ 'foo.in' ],
 		           var => [],
                           sig => [] } };

Unless the target is a status file (with attributes C<-sfile> or
C<-slink>), the action routine B<must> create the target file.  It
B<must> indicate the success or failure of the action by calling
B<die()> if there is an error:

  if_dep { -target => 'foo.out', -depend => 'foo.in' }
    action {
      my ( $deps ) = @_;

      frobnagle( 'foo.out' )
	or die( "error frobnagling!\n" );
    };

B<if_dep> will catch the B<die()>. There are two manners in which the
error will be passed on by B<if_dep>.  If B<if_dep> is called in a
void context (i.e., its return value is being ignored), it will
B<croak()> (See L<Carp>).  If called in a scalar context, it will
return C<true> upon success and C<false> upon error.  In either case
the C<$@> variable will contain the text passed to the original
B<die()> call.

The following two examples have the same result:

  eval{ if_dep { ... } action { ... } };
  die( $@ ) if $@;

  if_dep { ... } action { ... } or die $@;


=head2 Testing for a dependency

Sometimes life is so complicated that you need to first test for
a dependency before you know what to do.  In that case, use the
B<test_dep> function, which has the form

  test_dep( targdep )

where I<targdep> is identical to that passed to the B<if_dep>
function.  In a scalar environment, B<test_dep> will return true if
the dependency is not met.  In a list environment, it will return a
hash (not a hashref) with the dependency information (the same hash as
passed to the B<action> routine, but here it's a hash, not a hash
ref).  For example:

  if ( test_dep( @targdep ) )
  {
    # dependency was not met
  }

  %deps = test_dep( @targdep );


=head1 Subroutines

=over 8

=item Decision::Depends::Configure

This routine sets various attributes which control
B<Decision::Depends> behavior, including the file to which
B<Decision::Depends> writes its dependency information. Attributes are
option-value pairs, and may be passed as lists of pairs, arrayrefs
(containing pairs), or hashrefs (or any mix thereof):

  @attr2 = ( $attr => $value );
  $attr{$attr} = $value;
  Decision::Depends::Configure( \%attr, $attr => $value, \@attr );

A dependency file is not required if there are no signature or
variable dependencies.  In that case, if no attributes need be set,
this routine need not be called at all. 

The available attributes are 

=over 8

=item File

The name of a file which contains (or will contain) dependency
information.  In general this should be an absolute path, unless
the directory will not be changed.

=item Force

If set to a non-zero value, all dependencies will be out-of-date,
forcing execution of all actions.

=item Pretend

If set to a non-zero value, B<Decision::Depends> will simulate the actions
to track what might happen.

=item Verbose

If set to a non-zero value, B<Decision::Depends> will be somewhat verbose.

=back

For example,

  Decision::Depends::Configure( { File => $depfile Pretend => 1, Verbose => 1 } );


=back


=head1 EXPORT

The following routines are exported into the caller's namespace
B<if_dep>, B<action>, B<test_dep>.

=head1 NOTES

This module was heavily influenced by the ideas in the B<cons> software
construction tool.

The C<{targdep}> and C<{actions}> clauses to B<if_dep> are actually
anonymous subroutines.  Any subroutine reference will do in their
stead

  if_dep \&targdep 
    action \&actions;

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
