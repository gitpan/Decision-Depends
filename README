NAME
    Decision::Depends - Perform actions based upon file dependencies

DESCRIPTION
     Decision::Depends is a module which simplifies the creation
     of procedures with intermediate steps which can be skipped
     if certain dependencies are met.  Think of it as a
     procedural version of make.

     Decision::Depends is useful when there are several steps in
     a process, each of which depends upon the last.  If the
     process is interrupted, or if it is to be redone with
     changes to parameters in later steps, and if intermediate
     results can be kept, then Decision::Depends can insure that
     only the minimal number of steps be redone.

     Each step must result in a tangible product (a file).  For
     complicated steps with many products the step's successful
     completion may be indicated by creating an empty file whose
     existance indicates completion.  This file (a "status" file
     in Decision::Depends terminology) can be automatically
     created if requested.

     Decision::Depends determines if the product for a given step
     is older than any files required to produce it.  It can also
     check whether the contents of a file have changed since the
     product was last created.  This is useful in the case where
     a configuration file must be created anew each time, but
     results in action only if changed since the product was last
     created. Finally, it can determine if a variable's value has
     changed since the product was last created.

CAVEATS

    The tests poke at the innards. Be careful if you use them as
    examples that you don't use undocumented interfaces, as they may
    change (in particular, don't use $Decision::Depends::self).

CHANGES

    0.15
    ----
      dependency lists may now use hashrefs to associate attribute
      values with ordinary values.  this can be used to greatly
      simplify the set up of variable dependencies


    Major changes only. See the Changes file for more details.
